## Hi there 👋

I work at the intersection of software engineering and security, where systems are not merely built, but continuously interrogated. My professional focus is less on novelty for its own sake and more on understanding how complex technical systems behave under pressure: operational, social, and ethical.

Much of my work is motivated by a simple observation: modern software tends to outlive the context in which it was created. Code becomes infrastructure, decisions become defaults, and temporary tradeoffs harden into long-term constraints. This reality places a quiet responsibility on the people who design, implement, and secure these systems, whether they intend it or not.

## How I Think About Technology

I am interested in technology as a human artifact. Software encodes assumptions. Security reveals priorities. Documentation exposes what a system believes about its future users and maintainers. When these elements align, systems are legible and resilient. When they do not, complexity accumulates invisibly until failure forces it into view.

My approach favors clarity over cleverness, explicitness over intuition, and structure over improvisation. This applies as much to writing and design as it does to code. I am skeptical of solutions that cannot be explained plainly, and wary of abstractions that obscure accountability.

## What You Will Find Here

This profile is a public workspace rather than a portfolio in the traditional sense. Repositories may include:

- Exploratory projects intended to clarify an idea rather than ship a product
- Security-related tooling, notes, or experiments
- Writing or documentation that treats code as a form of durable knowledge
- Small, focused artifacts that exist to answer a specific question well

Not everything here is polished. Some things are deliberately unfinished. In many cases, the value lies in the reasoning process rather than the outcome.

## Writing as a Practice

I write to think, and I publish to force precision. Writing creates a record of what I believed at a particular moment, which makes it possible to revisit, revise, or discard those beliefs later. In that sense, writing serves a similar role to version control: it makes intellectual change observable.

This perspective carries through to how I approach technical work. Systems that cannot be explained cannot be trusted. Systems that cannot be critiqued cannot improve.

## Closing Note

If you are reading this, you are likely tracing ideas rather than products. That is intentional. I am less interested in presenting conclusions than in making the path to them visible.

Code, like writing, is ultimately an act of communication. My aim is to make that communication honest, legible, and durable.
